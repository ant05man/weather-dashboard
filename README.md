## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard that we have linked to an API page to get the information from so it can update the webpage. When the user searches for a city, then that city is added to the search history using localStorage. Then we are presented with an icon, weather conditions, the temperature, the humditiy, and the wind speed. A 5-day forecast for the future is presented as well.
